# 💳 Credit Card Requirements - What You Need to Know

## ⚠️ Reality Check

**All major free hosting platforms now require credit card verification:**

- ✅ **Koyeb**: Temporary $1 hold (refunded immediately)
- ✅ **Render**: Credit card required
- ✅ **Fly.io**: Credit card required

**However, they all:**
- ✅ **Don't charge** for free tier usage
- ✅ Use cards for verification/abuse prevention
- ✅ You can set spending limits
- ✅ Free tier remains free

---

## 🔒 Safety & Security

### Why They Require Cards:

1. **Abuse Prevention**: Prevents spam accounts and abuse
2. **Verification**: Verifies you're a real person
3. **Fraud Prevention**: Reduces fraudulent usage

### What They Do:

- ✅ **Koyeb**: Places $1 temporary hold, refunds immediately
- ✅ **Render**: May place small temporary authorization (refunded)
- ✅ **Fly.io**: May place small temporary authorization (refunded)

### What They DON'T Do:

- ❌ **Don't charge** for free tier usage
- ❌ **Don't auto-upgrade** you to paid plans
- ❌ **Don't charge** without your explicit action

## ✅ How to Stay Safe

### 1. Set Spending Limits

Most platforms allow you to set spending limits:
- Set limit to **$0** or minimum
- Prevents accidental charges

### 2. Monitor Usage

- Check dashboard regularly
- Review billing statements
- Set up usage alerts (if available)

### 3. Understand Free Tier Limits

- Stay within free tier limits
- Free tier won't incur charges
- Only paid features cost money

### 4. Use Prepaid Cards (If Available)

Some platforms accept prepaid cards:
- Limited funds = limited risk
- Check platform's payment options
